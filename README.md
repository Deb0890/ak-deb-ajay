- SQL Database:
  - Change within in a Neighborbood is less likely to occur therefore it will be appropriate to use an SQL database as we predict it to contain data which is related to one another.
  - Reasoning for choosing an SQL database is further emphasised by the assumption that each household will have a unique id associated with them, this unique id could then be accessed in another table, which can be paired with the number of people in their household. See the example below.

|  Street Name   | Unique Id | House Owner |
| :------------: | :-------: | :---------: |
|  Coding road   |     1     |     Bob     |
| Javascript Ave |     2     |    Steve    |
| zebra stripes  |     3     |     Dan     |
